      <h1>EARLY INFANT DIAGNOSIS For children</h1>
     <p style="text-align: left;"> Less Than 24 months old who are breastfeeding, the mother should be tested first. If she is HIV-positive, perform a Nucleic Acid
      Test(NAT) which can be done on the HIV-exposed infant (HEI), regardless of age. NAT can be performed on either a Dried Blood 
      Spot (DBS) which is sent to the laboratory or fresh blood sample using a Point-of-care machine (POC). The advantage of POC
      technologies is that they are available at the point of service delivery and offer same-day results. Infants who have HIV detectable by
      NAT at birth are likely to have been infected in-utero. These infants will progress to disease rapidly, and, in the absence of treatment,
      will experience high mortality in the first few months of life. Infants infected at or around delivery may not have t h e virus detectable
      by NAT for several days to weeks. The ability of NAT to detect the virus in the blood may be affected by ARV drugs taken by the
      mother or infant for postnatal prophylaxis, resulting in false-negative results. This includes drugs present in breast milk as a result of
      maternal ART during breastfeeding. 
      The rationale behind this recommendation is that infants who are first identified as HIV-exposed postpartum have a high cumulative
      risk of already having acquired HIV by the time prophylaxis is initiated; thus, NAT should be performed around the time of initiating
      prophylaxis, which would be at birth. This will help to minimize the risk of development of resistance because of extended prophylaxis
      in infected infants and help to promote linkage to timely initiation of ART</p>
